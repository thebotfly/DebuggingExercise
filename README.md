# Text RPG Debugging Exercise
## Decription
This application is a text based game that follows a simple battle ladder system. Using a turn based combat system, players must strategize to defeat each enemy as quickly as possible. The shorter a fight takes, the stronger the player becomes as a result. Defeat all enemies to win.
 
 ## Instructions
 This program is filled with errors. Fork your own copy of the repository, and fix all syntax and logical errors to get the program running as intended. The player should be able to choose a character, battle enemies, level up, and complete the game by either winning or losing. 
 Download the release to use as a reference for what the finished application should look like. Feel free to add any of your own creative additions to the game once all errors have been fixed.
